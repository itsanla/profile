  philosophy: `
    - **Deliberate Practice Over Vibe Coding:** Everything I do is intentional. 
      I prefer deep understanding over cargo-cult coding.

    - **Product-First Engineering:** I write code with a business purpose solving real 
      problems with measurable impact.

    - **AI as a Force Multiplier:** AI should enhance human intelligence, not replace it. 
      My work focuses on building AI agents, RAG systems, and AI-driven products that 
      empower users and automate complexity.

    - **Simplicity & Quality:** Clean architecture, clarity of thought, and long-term maintainability 
      matter more than flashy shortcuts.

    - **Continuous Reinvention:** I actively study entrepreneurship, psychology, systems thinking, 
      and peak performance to become a disciplined, wise, impactful man.
